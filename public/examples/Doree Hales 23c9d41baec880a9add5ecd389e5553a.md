### Issues & Recommendations

| Assessment | Plan | GP response |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Doreen stated that her pain is suboptimally controlled.  She is unable to walk more than few steps without needing assistance.  Her current medications to treat pain is occasional *Targin 2.5/1.25* and paracetamol. | Doreen may benefit from a higher and more regular opioid for pain.  Options include *Targin 5/2.5 BD or transdermal buprenorphine 5mcg*.  This may also assist with exercise to improve conditioning. |  |
| Doreen was concerned about her lack of appetite and thinks she is losing weight.  There are several comorbidities can cause fatigue such as diabetes, CCF, CKD, pain and interrupted sleep | Doreen may benefit from referral to a dietician with experience dealing with nutritional needs in diabetes and kidney disease.  |  |
| Referral for compression of the Cauda-equina nerve has lapsed as the appointment was going to be telehealth and Doreen did not wish to proceed if its no in-person | Please discuss with Doreen and if possible arrange an in-person referral. |  |
| Doreen has an order for 2mg perindopril, but is receiving scripts for 4mg.  She is having difficulty cutting them.  There is a 2mg strength of perindopril erbumine. | Please consider changing the Rx to 2mg for convenience. |  |

### Education & Advice

| Issue | Advice |
| --- | --- |
| Insulin use | Doreen didn’t have any particular method for determining her insulin doses.  She did not have any sick-day plans.  We discussed the importance of clear guidelines for these to reduce the chance of hypo or hyper glycemic events |
| Appetite | We discussed trying to maximise energy intake when eating to try and get as much benefit from each meal as possible |
