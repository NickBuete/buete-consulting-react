Dear Dr. Gupta

Thank you for referring Kim Taylor for a home medicines review.  The review took place on 22nd of Feb at Kim’s home.  Kim lives at home alone and manages her own medications.  Kim has a basic NDIS package for cleaning, but is hoping to increase her package to include meals.

Kim’s main medical concerns were her anxiety that affects a lot of her daily decisions and interrupts sleep.  Kim has some pain on a daily level and is not happy with her mental health and is hoping she can find medications with better efficacy.

Kim’s goals are to return to consistency within her medical team to ensure each practitioner is able to manage her morbidities without restricting access to medications she deems necessary.  Kim would like to return to volunteer work and to be reduce the burden that her anxiety has on her QOL.

### Issues & Recommendations

| Assessment | Plan | GP response |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Kim’s recent pathology revealed low Vitamin D levels. at 46nmol/L.  Kim does not like the sun and does not spend much time outside. | Consider Vitamin D supplementation.  As her levels were slightly low 1000IU should be sufficient |  |
| Kim was anxious about having lorazepam restricted as she feels it has helped her with sleep and mental health concerns.  Currently prescribed by Dr. Farnbach.  Current use is 1mg at night regularly for insomnia | Please discuss the rationale for lorazepam as a treatment for anxiety and how this can be managed in general practice if Dr. Farnbach is not available for a prescription |  |
| Kim noted some occasions of either missing or possibly doubling up on medications.  She reported a near-fall due to accidentally taking her evening medications twice. | Kim talked about using a DAA to assist with her medications.  She will consider this in the future. |  |
| Kim takes different doses of her medications than was reported.  She takes less brexipiprazole than reported, her lunch dose of Dexamphetamine is often omitted and doesn’t use Dymista due to cost | Please reconcile with her medication list to ensure accuracy.  There were several omissions, that have been included in this report |  |
| Kim was recommended *Otrivin Plus* to control hayfever symptoms.  This is a combination of a decongestant and ipratropium.  Kim uses this regularly and said it works quite well. | Kim was not aware that continued use of a decongestant nasal spray can cause a rebound congestion.  Please discuss the need to have a break from the medication.  Ipratropium can be compounded without the decongestant, but this might be too costly for Kim.  |  |

### Education & Advice

| Issue | Advice |
| --- | --- |
| Multiple prescribers and multiple medications with similar therapeutic intent | Kim was not sure when she would be able to consult with you on her mental health medications and when she would need to talk to Dr. Farnbach.  We talked about creating some clear guidelines with prescribers to ensure all are aware of the medications and their precise therapeutic intent as this ensure each prescriber can effectively manage in-lieu of others. |
