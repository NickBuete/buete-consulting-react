Dear Dr. Gupta

Thank you for referring Mia for a home medicines review.  The review took place on 26/07/2025 at Mia’s home.

### Issues & Recommendations

| Assessment | Plan | GP response |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mia is taking metoprolol 25mg BD.  There were no obvious indications for treatment in her PMH. | Please review indication and include on PMH or consider cessation if appropriate |  |
| Mia takes Meloxicam once per week, she also uses Aspirin 600mg for pain instead of P/forte on occasion.  She takes P/Osteo at night and about 20 parac/cod per week.  Due to the class and drug overlaps there is a risk of inadvertent overdose | Please discuss a rationalisation of pain management with step-wise up titration as pain increases.  Medications with sub-optimal therapeutic outcomes can be ceased |  |
| Mis had several medications on the referral that she does not take any more and some have been included that were not on the referral. | Please review and update current med list as appropriate.  Please consider the use of *Estrogel Pro* that includes progesterone rather than norethisterone + Oestorgen gel. |  |
| Mia stated that a lot of her medication and health decisions are weighed against the financial impact.    | When reviewing or recommending future treatments or tests Mia would like for the cost to be considered and where possible the least expensive route may be trialled first.  This may also include using medications with more than one therapeutic benefit. |  |

### Education & Advice

| Issue | Advice |
| --- | --- |
| 5 Questions | We discussed the 5-question builder as supported by the RACGP.  This will help Mia ask the right questions when discussing medications and medical treatments |
| Medication overlap | We discussed the potential for inadvertent overdose by taking medicaitons with the same active ingredients or with the same therapeutic class.   |
